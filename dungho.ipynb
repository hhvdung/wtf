to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mj s feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m kay br br visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him br br the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pesci s character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mj s music br br lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene br br bottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mj s bestest buddy in this movie is a girl michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention i ve gave this subject hmmm well i don t know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars i hope he is not the latter '\n"," ' the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year e g the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important bases like being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to h g wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings '\n"," 'the film starts with a manager nicholas bell giving welcome investors robert carradine to primal park a secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized dna like â jurassik parkâ and some scientists resurrect one of nature s most fearsome predators the sabretooth tiger or smilodon scientific ambition turns deadly however and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey the human visitors tourists and scientific meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre historical animals which are deadlier and bigger in addition a security agent stacy haiduk and her mate brian wimmer fight hardly against the carnivorous smilodons the sabretooths themselves of course are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature s most fearsome predators furthermore a third sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims br br the movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading hair raising chills full of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects the story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts running bound and leaps or dangling over walls and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene no for small kids by realistic gory and violent attack scenes other films about sabretooths or smilodon are the following â sabretooth 2002 â by james r hickox with vanessa angel david keith and john rhys davies and the much better â 10 000 bc 2006 â by roland emmerich with with steven strait cliff curtis and camilla belle this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by george miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films miller is an australian director usually working for television tidal wave journey to the center of the earth and many others and occasionally for cinema the man from snowy river zeus and roxanne robinson crusoe rating below average bottom of barrel '\n"," ...\n"," 'guy is a loser can t get girls needs to build up is picked on by stronger more successful guys etc seen it saw it moved on i d have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life and get out of the adam sandler plots there are two funny parts in the whole movie i couldn t even finish the last 5 minutes i was getting bored the animal is an alright film i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot but this was trying too hard to impress the jokes are very old so trust me this is not a film that most people could really get into but some did so i ll be nice br br 3 10 '\n"," 'this 30 minute documentary buã uel made in the early 1930 s about one of spain s poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films first let s admit that 70 years later spain is much richer than it was then and when i say this i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth it s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buã uel favored but with western european style capitalism but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of pi teaching math to poor people the horror buã uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation what is he proposing that children are taught exactly what at school doesn t buã uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people '\n"," 'i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that can t be undone and the need for others chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when chirin follows him into the mountain the wolf doesn t kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe i ll eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this intricacy of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but i ve never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and i m glad i saw it as a child ']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MuDNaiSOE6hE","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Accuracy
